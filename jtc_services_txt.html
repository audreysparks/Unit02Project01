                        <li> <p>I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. 
                        They did the job with no damage to my garage and cleaned it all up 
                        that same day. Great service. </p>

                            an estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and at the lowest bid.
